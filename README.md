Introducing a comprehensive sniper bot tailored for trading Solana meme coins using the Jito protocol. This bot enables users to purchase new tokens and automatically sell them at predetermined profit margins. It simplifies trading by executing tasks that would typically be performed manually.

Why Choose This Bot?
I have dedicated months to developing and refining this bot, experimenting with various strategies to ensure profitability. My personal journey with this bot has seen my investments grow from 5 SOL to 17 SOL in just three weeks. While initial trials led to a loss of 10 SOL, these experiences were crucial in perfecting the bot's performance and speed. Users can easily customize strategies by modifying the .env file. Compared to other bots in the market, mine offers faster transaction capabilities through Jito, providing a competitive edge. This bot is affordable for newcomers and charges a minimal transaction fee of 0.1% on buys and sells, plus a licensing fee that supports ongoing enhancements and updates.
